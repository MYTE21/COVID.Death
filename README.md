# COVID.Death

![activity.png](assets/activity.png) `Active`

A contagious illness called `Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)` is brought on by the `SARS-CoV-2 Virus`.
Most COVID-19 patients experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment.
However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19)

The global dataset of the `Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)` is examined in this study with the major focuses being on
`mortality` and `vaccination`. By the project's conclusion, it will be possible to display a variety of elements relating
to humans and the Coronavirus, including effects, comparisons, time-series, and many more.

**Dataset:** [Coronavirus (COVID-19) Deaths ðŸ”—](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)

## Goals

The main objectives of this project include:

1. `Exploring` and `Analyzing` the global dataset Coronavirus.
2. Constructing an `Interactive Dashboard` to display the Coronavirus's global impact.

## Used Technologies

* `MySql`: Exploring, analysing and generating dataset for visualization.
* `Tableau`: Creating dashboard.
* `IDE`: [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/)

## Description

Querying and visualization make up the two sections of this project. It is handled separately for each part.
The SQL files `introduction.sql`, `death.sql`, `vaccination.sql`, and `death_and_vaccination.sql` provide the queries
for data exploration. To generate the resources required for data visualization, there is one more file named
`tableau.sql`. The original Tableau visualization file is available at this URL - [Tableau: Covid - 19 Infected
Population](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/myte/viz/Covid-19InfectedPopulation/Dashboard1).
A discussion of additional details follows. So, let's get started.

### Queries

The first question regarding the [Coronavirus (COVID-19) Deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) dataset is
what fields we will come across and which of them will be most helpful for this survey. Calculating the affected and
mortality numbers is crucial based on previous pandemic experiences. The provision of medical care and prevention are
the next things following them. Therefore, we separated our actual dataset into two separate datasets based on `death`
and `vaccination`. The `introduction.sql` query has a section on this.

### Visualizations

## Introduction [introduction.sql]

* Create Database called `covid`.
* Select `covid` database.
* Create table `owid_covid_data` from the  `owid_covid_data` csv dataset.
* Create description of the table and store it as a csv file named - `description_of_owid_covid_data.csv`.
* Create 2 tables form `owid_covid_data`
  * `covid_death` - Covid-19 Death
  * `covid_vaccination` - Covid-19 Vaccination

## Covid-19 Death [death.sql]

* Select `covid` database.
* Show `covid_death` table
* Select `location`, `date`, `total_cases`, `new_cases`, `total_deaths` and `population` for initial analysis.
* Total Cases VS Total Deaths
* Total Cases VS Population
* Countries Infection Rate compared to Population
* Countries with Highest Death Count Compared to Population
* Continents with Highest Death Count Compared to Population
* Global Cases and Deaths considering each date
* Global Total Death Percentage

## Covid-19 Vaccination [vaccination.sql]

* Select `covid` database.
